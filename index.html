You may have wondered what the small secret pleasures of your friends, neighbors, or even boss might be. The bad news – though it could be considered good after all – is that unless you try questioning them yourself, you'll never know much more. This is why many clichés are still going strong. Are there really fewer homosexuals amongst Catholics? Is sodomy more frequent among left-wingers or right-wingers? Go ahead and test your a priori on sex with total impunity.</p></section> <section class="bloc_histoire"> <h1 id="religion" class="titre"> <a class="scrollTo" href="#accueil">Sexuality and religion</a> </h1><h1 class="titre_subsection">Sodom and Gomorra, where do we stand ?</h1> <div id='quizz1' class="fenetre"> <div class="infographie"> <div id="chiffreInfoCathos"></div><div id="imagesCathos" class="pictoCatho"></div><div id="imagesAthees" class="pictoCatho"></div></div><div class="commentaire"> <p> Not so much of a difference !

Women ! Among men with a high school diploma up to a college education, <span class='chiffre'>48%</span> declare often sucking or licking their partner's genitals. Among those who don't have a high school diploma, this percentage goes up to <span class='chiffre'>50%</span>.

Those with a high school diploma or a higher degree are more likely to use their mouths <span class='emph'>often</span> and less likely to <span class='emph'>never</span> use them. What does this opposite effect between men and women convey? Education contributes to narrowing the gap in terms of sexual practices between genders, so that everyone can enjoy the lingual talents of the opposite sex! All this information is summed up on the graph below. </p></div></div></section> <section class="bloc_histoire"> <h1 id="politique" class="titre"> <a class="scrollTo" href="#accueil">Politics free <br/>of complexes</a> </h1> <h1 class="titre_subsection">... and politicized love</h1> <p class="pPleinePage"> As you've seen earlier, sexual tastes vary according to religious affiliations.

Those latter are also the most reticent about homosexual relations.

The same U-shaped scheme is found again concerning sexual relations with more than two people at once. The Front National and Front de Gauche are in the lead, with respectively <span class='chiffre'>22%</span> and <span class='chiffre'>21%</span> of their electors having already given their love to several people at the same time.
